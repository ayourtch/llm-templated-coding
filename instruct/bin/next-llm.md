Please write a Rust program as below.

The program takes one argument, which is the string, say it is "foo".

It should look into both instruct/bin/ and src/bin/ subdirectories for the files named "llm-foo-<number>.md" and "llm-foo-<number>.rs" respectively and find the biggest number value.

Then it should print that value.

Do not use any markdown separators please.

Provides clear error messages and status updates.

Only updates the file when the new implementation is deemed better.
